Code for "CHeart: A Conditional Spatio-Temporal Generative Model for Cardiac Anatomy"
CHeart, a novel conditional generative model for 4D cardiac anatomy. By leveraging both imaging and non-imaging data, the model is able to generate realistic and dynamic anatomical sequences for the heart, given personalised conditions such as demographic and anthropometric factors.
